# PowerBI-Dashboard

# Blinkit Sales Dashboard 📊

This project is a Power BI dashboard built to explore Blinkit's sales data—one of India’s top quick-commerce delivery platforms. It helps uncover insights about what products people prefer, how different city tiers perform, and how outlet trends change over time.

### 🔍 Why I Made This
I wanted to challenge myself with real-world e-commerce data and build something that doesn’t just show numbers—but tells a story. From fat content breakdowns to outlet-level trends, this dashboard gives a clear view of what’s happening behind the scenes at Blinkit.

### 🛠️ What It Includes
- Sales by product category & fat content
- Performance by Tier 1, 2, and 3 cities
- Trends over time (outlet growth, sales spikes)
- Clean, interactive visuals with filters

### 📚 What I Learned
This project helped me improve my skills in Power BI, DAX, and storytelling with data. I also gained a better sense of how to design dashboards for real business decisions—not just reports.

### 🚀 What’s Next
- Add real-time data
- Predictive features like sales forecasting
- Mobile-friendly design
- Let users ask natural language questions like “Show snack sales in Tier 2”
